# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in Food & Agriculture: Review Materials

Human-Computer Interaction is a discpline in which we consider the human experience of technology. We explore how and why people use technology to do work, design tools to accomodate the needs, capabilities, and desires of different types of users, and ultimately seek to improve the relationship between humans and technologies.

## Overview of the Topic

 

## Short Synopsis of Materials
1. HCI - brief intro
This article is a brief history and explanation of HCI. The concept of HCI began when personal computers were developed and
their use was spreading rapidly. HCI has had to change and adapt as computers became smaller, more portable, and integrated into other
objects such as cars. HCI now overlaps with many fields
