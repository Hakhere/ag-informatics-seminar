# 1. Project Contract
**In the first 2 weeks of this semester, you will create a 1 page Project Contract and meet with the Instructor**. This document should describe:

1. What you will submit as your final project: research paper or software prototype? Make sure the description of your proposed work is clear and brief.

2. Who is your support? This is ideally something you're interested in working on for your research, portfolio, practice, etc., and is something you have additional support for outside this course (e.g., a mentor, advisor, etc.). If you were in ASM591 last Fall, feel free to build off of your project, or do something else entirely, whatever is most useful for you.

3. What is the scope of the work? Include the timeline of your activitites with the intended final submission date lining up with Week 16 of Spring 2022.

4. What do you anticipate sharing during your Project work-in-progress Update? We can discuss what's appropriate, but suggest something to begin with!

4. Upload this document to Brightspace by Week 3, Monday @ 5pm. This is not graded separately, but if you do not submit something, you will lose 5% of your final project grade.

5. Schedule a meeting with the Instructor, Ankita, so that we can agree that this is an appropriate amount of work. Make sure you have submitted your project contract online at least 1 day before we meet. You will work on your project independently over the course of the semester. I will be available to provide feedback, guidance, and general support. You will have an opportunity for peer feedback during your Workshop Presentation. **Use this link: [https://calendly.com/sudokita/project-contract-meeting](https://calendly.com/sudokita/project-contract-meeting)**

# 2. Topic Analysis
I will assign a set of materials for Discussion weeks (see schedule above). Each student is expected to read/view/parse these materials and write a one page reflection. **You will submit a 1-2 page topic analysis every Discussion week, starting Week 2.** Your topic analysis should contain the following:

1. Heading: contains your name, the week, the date, and the discussion topic title.

2. Summary: A 1 paragraph summary of the topic based on the readings and other materials shared for the week.

3. Analysis: A 2-3 paragraph analysis about what you think the open issues are in this area of research and practice. You can include critiques of the papers and other materials, and bring in other concepts you think are relevant to the discussion. Consider writing about your reactions to the topic, your ideas/positions on the topic driven/contradicted by the materials, or 

4. Questions: A list of 3-5 questions for the in-class discussion.

*Rubric Coming Soon.*

**Upload this as a PDF to Brightspace the Monday before our class @ 5pm.**

# 3. Topic Brief
**During the week you are assigned as "Discussion Moderator" you will create a set of prompts/questions to lead the discussion, and summarize the group discussion as a "Topic Brief".** If you are the assigned moderator for the Discussion week, you DO NOT have to create the "Topic Analysis" described above. 

Instead you will need to do the following:

1. Closely parse the assigned materials.

2. Navigate to the relevant discussion topic folder in Github. Make sure you have cloned and done a recent "pull" on the course repository so you have the latest updates.

3. You will edit the README.md file for YOUR discussion topic, filling out all the required sections:
	- Topic Overview
	- Positions (from the materials)
	- Opportunities for Design
	- Challenges in the Space
	- Discussion Questions
	- Supplemental Resource Recommendations

4. Make a "Pull Request" on the main course repository and I will integrate your changes so that everyone can view your brief just before class.

5. Come prepared to lead the discussion. You will be expected to give a 10 minute presentation, using slides, your notes, whatever you'd like, to kick-off the discussion in-class.

*Rubric Coming Soon.*

# 4. Project in-progress Update

Everyone is expected to present once during the semester. There is no set format for your project update. Instead consider the following order of operations:

1. By 5pm the Monday before your assigned workshop presentation, you MUST send out something for your peers to review. This can be a link to a prototype, a paper draft, and outline of your methods, whatever you are working on as your Agricultural Informatics "project" for this semester. You must additionally provide your peers with guidance about what you'd like feedback ON. Your submission can look like this:
 - a draft of your paper, a link to the prototype on github, a video of your mockups. You need to provide people something to actually review!
 - a short set of instruction about what type of feedback you'd like: do you want people to look for holes in your paper rationale? some light user testing?

2. During your assigned timeslot, we will give you 20 minutes to provide an update, we will then spend the rest of the class in feedback discussion. 

*Rubric Coming Soon.*

# 5. Project Peer Feedback

ou will provide templated feedback for each of your peers. I will share these with the presenter so these must be written in a constructive tone. 

*Rubric Coming Soon.*

# 6. Project Final Submission
If you chose to build something this semester, I'll ask for a short report to accompany it overviewing your work. If you chose to write a paper, you can just submit the paper itself.
