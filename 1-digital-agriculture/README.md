# Overview of the topic

The history of agriculture in the world is one of constant innovation in the hopes of improving production, yield, or quality in some fashion. Often these have come as new challenges arise. Today the Ag industry is facing the threat of environmental impacts, increased consumption, resource constraints, and other issues that loom over producers. Similar industries have found success in solving problems through technological advancement and digitalization. The hope of this same method applying to the Ag industry is high, but not without challenges. With concerns properly solved, "Digital Agriculture" has the potential to shape every part of the production process from inputs to consumer. Using technologies such as sensors, decision support tools, artificial intelligence, drones, and more are expected to culminate in a new way of conducting business that promotes sustainability and the thoughtful increase in production needed for our world.
 

# Short Synopsis of Readings

1) *"Big Data in Smart Farming - A review"* : Describes Big Data as "massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analyzed and used for decisions-making". The process of managing this is shown as an inter-connected cycle of smartly sensing, analyzing, and controlling the data. Notable push factors driving development in this area include "General technological developments", "Sophisticated technology", "Data generation and storage", "Digital connectivity", and "Innovation possibilities". Pull factors included are "Business drivers", "Public drivers" and the "General need for more and better information'. Ultimately the focus being on how data is connected to the future of agriculture; as well as the role, players, effects, and challenges that are associated with the implementation of data.

2) *"Digital Technologies in Agriculture and Rural Areas"* : Highlights the need to consider the effects of digitalization on rural populations, especially in concern of further economic and educational division for these groups. Throughout the article there are introductions of 3 considerations and 3 ways in which these could lead to transformation. The first being the lack of IT infrastructure in the areas in which most farms operate, however with proper internet access and the lowering of the barrier of entry into technology progress can be made. Digital literacy and skills are shown to be lacking in many rural populations, but with ICT education programs and other skills based learning the structure of the labor market could change. Finally policy and programs regarding digital ag need updating, one area referred to as agripreneurship could be set up as a way for farmers to take ownership in their desired tech and would allow for the creating of their own start-ups. 

3) *"Patterns of Inequalities in Digital Agriculture: A Systematic Literature Review"* : Provides 5 common ways in which inequalities are or will occur between corporate entities and farmers. These 5 ways are identified as a lack of interoperability where tech is not working together, a system where those with money are benefiting from progress and those without money are not, an issue of farmers not having the right to work on their own equipment, farmers not having the ability or skills to work with digital tools, and only large corporations shaping the conversations around Digital Ag and related policy. Additionally, this reading is introducing how both intentional product and policy can overcome these 5 key identified problems.

4) *"Agriculture’s connected future: How technology can yield new growth"* : Focuses on the need for connectivity in order for advancement in Digital Ag and joining industries. Accomplishes this by showing a clear path from the history of connectivity to the vision of a connected future. Shown are 5 unique use cases, Crop monitoring, Livestock monitoring, Building and equipment management, Farming by drone, and Autonomous farming machinery, that are believed to have the most potential growth as a result of increased connectivity. Included are countless numerical projections of their expected size and scope of various industries. The how of connectivity is suggested to lie with strategic partnerships with telcos and LPWAN companies or through government funding similar to that of Germany or Korea.

5) *"Digital Agriculture"* : Provides a broad overview of the context of Digital Agriculture and shares a vision for the future with Digital Ag. Most notably touching on the ability of Digital Ag to impact the UN's "Sustainable Development Goals", among which are 9 of the 17 goals in which it is believe the biggest impacts will be had. These being SDG 2 "Zero Hunger", SDG 6 "Availability and sustainable", SDG 8 "Decent work and economic growth", SDG 9 "Industry, innovation and infrastructure", SDG 11 "Sustainable cities and communities", SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production", SDG 14/15 "Life on land/below water", and SDG 17 Partnerships for the goals". The article also admits the challenges and considerations that must be resolved in order for this plan to operate properly.

# Summary of Key Takeaways from the Materials

1) *The world population by 2050 is the key motivator.* Among many of these articles there are variations of the quote "by 2050 the world population is expected to reach 9.6 billion people". This is leveraged by authors to show the current and future stresses of the Ag industry, of which there are many. Feeding a larger population and producing more food with less resources such as land and water are the reason why innovation and new solutions are necessary. Digital Ag appears to most as the proper solution for these impending issues.

2) *Consideration of all parties is key to success.* Smallholders make up a large portion of the overall ag industry, but could also suffer the most from digitalization. Inequalities are already beginning to exist among those with money and connectivity and those without. Smaller players are not being included in conversations, yet are strategically important to the overall mission of Digital Ag. Raising the entire industry requires collaborative work and all groups to have a seat at the table.

3) *Adoption is hinged on solving roadblocks.* As with any change to the way a process is conducted there are obvious challenges. Each reading notes what they believe the biggest hurdles are to growth, many share overlapping themes. However, all share the distinction of showing how there are true fundamental factors blocking technology from entering the farming sector, and potentially even more challenges that are likely to arise once it does. All of these present clear threats and show what is needed to make Digital Ag happen.

4) *Digitalization is the next Agricultural Revolution.* Technology, especially through data analysis and improved software, holds the potential to change the way producers produce. Agriculture can be made more efficient, productive, and sustainable through Digital Ag. Ultimately the goal may be to feed the future, but first we must revolutionize the way that is done.

# Discussion Questions

# Discussion Notes and Feedback
Group Definitions:

* Digital Ag is the addition of technology into Agriculture
* Digital Ag appears as a recently emerging technology, but in many ways is simply collecting and analyzing data by using computers, rather than manually
* There is a difference between Smart Ag and Digital Ag. Smart Ag seeks to answer when, what, and how operations are performed in Ag. Digital Ag asks why an operation was or should be performed.

Class Takeaways:

* No single entity can drive this entire system
* Empowering customers is a beneficial side effect of Digital Ag
* Capitalism is causing and perpetuating problems
* If data is all centralized it will lead to data warfare
* There feels like only two options: no profit or prop up the current system of greed
* Security is a key concern as we move forward
* There are two possible futures contingent on one question: is being more connected a good or bad thing?
* The cost of digital agriculture, especially its impact on laborers, takes a toll is important to note

Additional Insights:

* Each individual source has a distinct focus on a different area of Digital Ag or concentrates on and defines a key problem within the topic area.
