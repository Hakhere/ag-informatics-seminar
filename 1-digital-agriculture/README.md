# Overview of the topic

The history of agriculture in the world is one of constant innovation in the hopes of improving production, yield, or quality in some fashion. Often these have come as new challanges arise. Today the Ag industry is facing the threat of enivronmental impacts, increased consumption, resource constraints, and other issues that loom over producers. Similar industies have found success in solving problems through technological advancement and digitalization. The hope of this same method applying to the Ag industry is high, but not without challanges. With concerns properly solved, "Digital Agriculture" has the potential to shape every part of the production process from inputs to consumer. Using technologies such as sensors, decision support tools, artificial intelligance, drones, and more are expected to cullminate in a new way of conducting business that promotes sustainability and the thoughtful increase in production needed for our world.
 

# Short Synopsis of Readings

1) *"Big Data in Smart Farming - A review"* : Describes what Big Data is and how it is connected to the future of agriculture. The role, players, effects, and challenges that are associated with the implementation of data are all addressed.

2) *"Digital Technologies in Agriculture and Rural Areas"* : Highlights the need to consider the effects of digitalization on rural populations, especially in concern of further economic and educational division for these groups. 

3) *"Patterns of Inequalities in Digital Agriculture: A Systematic Literature Review"* : Provides 5 common ways in which inequalities are or will occur between corporate entities and farmers, while introducing how both intentional product and policy can overcome these.

4) *"Agriculture’s connected future: How technology can yield new growth"* : Focuses on the need for connectivity in order for advancement in Digital Ag and joining industries; also includes numerical projections of size and scope of various industries and how they may grow.

5) *"Digital Agriculture"* : Provides a broad overview of the context of Digital Agriculuture and shares a vision for the future with Digital Ag.

# Summary of Key Takeways from the Materials

1) *The world population by 2050 is the key motivator.* Among many of these articles there are varitions of the quote "by 2050 the world population is expected to reach 9.6 billion people". This is leveraged by authors to show the current and future stresses of the Ag industry, of which there are many. Feeding a larger population and producing more food with less resources such as land and water are the reason why innovation and new solutions are necessary. Digital Ag appears to most as the proper solution for these impending issues.

2) *Consideration of all parties is key to success.* Smallholders make up a large portion of the overall ag industry, but could also suffer the most from digitalization. Inequalities are already beginning to exist among those with money and connectivity and those without. Smaller players are not being included in conversations, yet are strategically important to the overall mission of Digital Ag. Raising the entire industry requires collaborative work and all groups to have a seat at the table.

3) *Adoption is hinged on solving roadblocks.* As with any change to the way a process is conducted there are obvious challenges. Each reading notes what they believe the biggest hurdles are to growth, many share overlapping themes. However, all share the distinction of showing how there are true fundamental factors blocking technology from entering the farming sector, and potentially even more challanges that are likely to arise once it does. All of these present clear threats and show what is needed to make Digital Ag happen.

4) *Digitalizaiton is the next Agricultural Revolution.* Technology, especially through data analysis and improved software, holds the potential to change the way producers produce. Agriculture can be made more efficient, productive, and sustainable through Digital Ag. Ultimately the goal may be to feed the future, but first we must revolutionize the way that is done.
