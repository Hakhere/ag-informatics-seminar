**Reading Reflections** I will assign a set of materials for Discussion weeks (see schedule above). Each student is expected to read/view/parse these materials and write a one page reflection. There will be a template available for this. **Submission via Brightspace**

**Discussion Brief** During the week you are assigned as "Discussion Moderator" you will, in addition to doing your own reading, create a set of prompts/questions to lead the discussion, and summarize the group discussion as a "Discussion Brief". There will be a template available for this. **You will submit this via Github AND submit the link on Brightspace**.

**Work-in-Progress Update** You will need to sign up to provide a single Work-in-Progress update to the class. You will share your work with the class and set up a one-on-one meeting with the instruction a week prior to discuss your work if you would like to. This will be an opportunity to get peer and instructor feedback on your work. This will be **ungraded**, since each student's work-in-progress will differ. **You will submit your materials to share with the class via Brightspace**

**Project Peer Feedback** You will provide templated feedback for each of your peers. I will share these with the presenter so these must be written in a constructive tone. **Submission via Brightspace**

**Project Final Packet** If you chose to build something this semester, I'll ask for a short report to accompany it overviewing your work. If you chose to write a paper, you can just submit the paper itself. **Submission via Brightspace**
